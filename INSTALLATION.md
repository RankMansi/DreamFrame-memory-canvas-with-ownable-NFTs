# DreamFrame Installation and Usage Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the DreamFrame application - a memory photo aesthetic editor with NFT minting capabilities.

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- MetaMask browser extension for NFT minting

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dreamframe.git
cd dreamframe

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

This will also automatically download the required face detection models for AI features.

### Step 2: Set Up Local Blockchain (for NFT Minting)

```bash
# Start a local Hardhat blockchain node
npm run blockchain
```

This will:
- Start a local blockchain on http://localhost:8545
- Deploy the NFT smart contract
- Fund test accounts with ETH for minting

Keep this terminal window open and running.

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- **Minting Errors**: Check that the blockchain is running (`npm run blockchain`) and you have sufficient test ETH in your MetaMask wallet.

## ðŸ“± Mobile Usage

While DreamFrame works on mobile browsers, for the best experience:
- Use a desktop or laptop computer for advanced editing features
- Ensure you have the MetaMask mobile app installed for NFT minting on mobile devices
