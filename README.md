# üì∏ DreamFrame: Memory Photo Aesthetic & NFT Minting

DreamFrame started as an AI-powered emotion-to-art app, but now it's evolving into a **memory photo aesthetic editor** with built-in NFT minting. Instead of generating images from prompts, users will **upload their own cherished photos**‚Äîfor example, a childhood snapshot in your mother's arms‚Äîand transform them with beautiful, customizable filters and frames. Once perfected, each "memory frame" can be minted as a unique NFT and preserved forever on-chain.

## ‚ú® What You'll Build

1. **Photo Upload & Preview**  
   Users can drag & drop or browse to upload a personal memory photo.

2. **Aesthetic Filter Suite**  
   - Choose from pre-built filter presets (e.g. Polaroid, Vintage, Pastel, Monochrome).  
   - Fine-tune intensity, contrast, brightness, grain, and vignette.  
   - Add artistic frames or "film" borders (Polaroid style, 35 mm slide, retro instant).

3. **Custom Overlay & Text**  
   - Type a date, location, or short caption to overlay on the image.  
   - Pick fonts and placement (e.g. handwritten, typewriter, neon).

4. **Live Preview & Download**  
   See changes in real time and download your edited artwork as a high-resolution PNG.

5. **NFT Minting Extension**  
   - Upload the final image to IPFS (via Pinata or local node).  
   - Mint an ERC-721 NFT on a test or mainnet blockchain.  
   - Store metadata (caption, filter settings, original upload date) alongside image URI.  
   - View your minted token in a gallery or on OpenSea.

6. **AI-Enhanced Editing (NEW!)**
   - Professional-grade photo editing with Pintura integration
   - AI-powered auto-enhancement to optimize your photos
   - Face detection for smart caption placement
   - Advanced editing tools for precision adjustments
